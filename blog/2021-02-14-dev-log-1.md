Konnichiwa, Matteo desu.

Data fetishist here, it has been quite a while since the release of the Animeshon’s Encyclopedia and Detabesu and since then no major updates have been released.

Today, to celebrate the Beta v21.02.0 release we want to introduce you to our new initiative, the **weekly updates**, as well as illustrate the **progress** done so far, what are we releasing, and what are our plans for the upcoming steps.



# Weekly Updates

Animeshon’s Team is putting a great effort into the project, but the occasion to show our activity and enthusiasm are still very few.
We believe that short but regular updates about the project will help the community to keep in touch with Animeshon’s development as well as documenting our will of building something great. We are therefore planning to write and post every week about our progress. The updates might, of course, be very short or very long, depending on what we achieved in that particular week. Nevertheless, we believe it will become an interesting appointment for both the community and the Animeshon staff.



# Detabesu and Encyclopedia
On the 20th of December, we released the first Beta version of the Encyclopedia along with Detabesu. The Beta was primarily meant to be a showcase and testing field for Detabesu, rather than a functional product.
Thanks to the feedback received we have been working hard on this development iteration to improve and tune our infrastructure and components to get closer to a stable and final product. A product we believe will bring huge value to the community.

## Dev Iteration insight

During the last development iteration, many steps forward have been made. New features, tuning of already existing components, and big achievements. In the next section, I will provide some insight into the progress as well as some consideration about the status quo of Detabesu and the Encyclopedia.

* Detabesu Schema and data structure
* Detabesu usability
* Crossreferences
* Schema Stitching
* Universe and Canonicals
* User Contribution Alpha V1


### Detabesu Schema and data structure
As we all know, the **Japanese Multimedia Industry** is a ***unique ecosystem***, full of exceptions and open to a very wide range of opinions. Which makes it very difficult to manage and consolidate. Aiming for a “Design first” approach is therefore not suitable for this specific world: with every additional data source we introduce in the system, with every new use case we face, and with every new component we develop, the whole design of data structure and data management has to be *rediscussed and fine-tuned*.

What we aim to achieve with Databesu is not only the consolidation of the information about the Japanese Multimedia Contents but the consolidation of the data structure itself.

```
What is an Anime? 
What is a One-Shot? 
Is a Manwhua still a Manga? 
Are Web Toons considered Japanese Multimedia Contents? 
What is the meaning of Doujinshi and how can we categorize them?
```

Those are some of the questions we want Detabesu to be able to answer using a well documented and universally accepted standard, a standard we have to build from scratch with the help of the community.



###  Detabesu usability

Detabesu’s potential is bind to the underlying Graph Database Dgraph, an experimental Database Animeshon diced to use because of the native GraphQL implementation Dgraph provides.
Being Detabesu an **experimental project** build on top of another **experimental technology**, we are well aware of the current limitation of our GraphQL endpoints.
One simple example is the impossibility to sort results by name or by date at query time. Or the difficulty a developer has to face to filter a particular Media type (EG: `give me only the related Visual Novel of this content`).

We plan to ease some of those difficulties by constantly updating the Detabesu internal data structure and GraphQL endpoints in order to provide the simplest but smartest data graph possible.
For the rest, we are bound with the underlying Dgraph development cycle, which fortunately is going in a very interesting direction, as this [Feature Request](https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/ordering-by-nested-field/12613) proves.

**Overall we believe that our choice of using Dgraph will pay off in the long run. In fact even now, in Beta Testing, even if not complete and even if the data structure is not stable, Detabesu’s querying power has no equal in the industry.**


### Crossreferences

In this development iteration, we put a big effort in the improvement of the crossreference across our data and external sources.

The first big improvement is the **redesign of the concept of crossreferencing itself**: we arrived at the conclusion that the current status of the external sources do not allow a 1 to 1 crossreference, and we updated our data structure in order to be able to capture and serve those mismatches.

One simple example comes from the classification of `Kizumonogatari` across multiple websites: 
**AniDB** treats the 3 movies as one single big anime, while other services like **MyAnimeList** splits the story into 3 different Anime (with subtype Movie).
There are many other corner cases where **MyAnimeList** *groups* what **AniDB** and **AnimeNewsNetwork** *divide*, or some hybrid mismatch.

Anyway, we changed our concept of crossreference allowing it to express partial crossreferences across external sources and Animeshon.
For instance, the above example of `Kizumonogatari` has been solved by ***linking every Movie of MyAnimeList to Animeshon’s resources, and partially linking the big AniDB’s Anime to Animeshon’s resource***.

Searching for Anidb’s `Kizumonogatari` crossreference in Detabesu, you will get 3 cross-reference nodes, pointing to Animeshon’s resources, with the flag `partial` set as **true**,
while traversing Animeshon’s `Kizumonogatari - Nekketsu` node you will find the crossreference to MyAnimelist’s `Kizumonogatari - Nekketsu` Anime with the flag `partial` set as **false** and AniDB’s `Kizumonogatari` Anime with the flag `partial` set as **true**.

Secondly, we spend a lot of time improving the algorithm responsible for the cross-reference generation. We invested a lot in this regard because at release time the algorithm was too simple and couldn’t automatically detect most of the crossreferences, leaving the operators (we) with 35k+ Manga, 20k+ Light Novels, and 200k+ Characters crossreference to manually approve or discard.
Utilizing as much as possible the crossreference available on external sources (AniDB provides a good amount of Anime cross-references, and Mangadex has an extraordinary amount of manga crossreference), and making the algorithm smarter we were able to lower the number to few thousand crossreference (excluded doujinshi which have the poorest support) left for manual approvals.

| Manga | Anime | Light Novel | Character 
| - | - | - | - 
| 35k+ | 3k+ | 20k+ | 250k+

*Number of Crossreference wating to be manually approved at `Beta Release`*


| Manga | Anime | Light Novel | Character 
| - | - | - | - 
| 17k+ | 700+ | 1.8k+ | 130k+ 

*Number of Crossreference wating to be manually approved at `V21.02.0 Release`*

The result of this operation is a more complete dataset available in production.


### Schema Stitching

Schema stitching means taking more than one database containing different data and merging their endpoints together giving the external world the illusion that we have only one very big database serving a **big datagrah**.
In the current version of Detabesu, the Query querySearch, asking for information to an Elasticsearch cluster, returns a list of ids, which have to be tested again against Detabesu to retrieve the information. This leads to quite some delay (data have to be received from the Elasticsearch processed and resent to Detabesu) and a lot of boiler plating on the client-side to transform the list of ids in a new request.
Thanks to the schema stitching, this task will be interpolated directly in our GraphQL Gateway (available [here](http://api.animeshon.com/graphql)) and the whole process is transparent to the outer world: the `querySearch` after Beta v21.02.0 release returns an array of Search Results, which can be expanded to actual types in a single query.

While it might seem a very small achievement, it will serve as the foundation for the realization of our ecosystem, where Ashen will be directly plugged in Detabesu, an AI-based recommendation system using data about both user preferences and Content relations and where the Animeshon Media Platform can integrate Detabesu knowledge. 
While behind the scenes there will be a lot of different services and architectures, the outer world will see a big, single, solid graph. Traversable in any direction without the need of manual client-side custom logic.


### Universe and Canonicals

A very big achievement of this development iteration is the generation of the **first Universes and Canonicals**.
This milestone is quite important for us for 2 main reason:
It is the first unique value Detabesu brings to the user
It is the first time Animeshon generates brand new information instead of using already available information

**Definition:**
We defined Universes as a set of content sharing the same base-story, characters, or references. EG: `Science Adventures Series` is a universe which groups the Steins;Gate story, Chaos;Head story, … The contents in the universe share some elements, the story-line and the single stories are relevant to each other.

We defined Canonicals (or Series) as a set of content about the SAME story. EG: `Steins;Gate` is a Canonical grouping all Anime, Visual Novel, Manga, Drama CD about the events of Okabe Rintarou creating a time machine by chance, and struggling to achieve the world line called Steins;Gate. 

We tried to utilize already known information to automatically generate universes and canonicals, but because the concept is new and prior Detabesu the definition was blurry, we ended up spinning a back office that allows operators to manually generate universes and canonicals in some minutes. We also discarded, for now, the automatic generation because our dataset is still not good enough to tell where a universe starts, where a canonical ends, and which contents are crossover between different universes/canonicals. 

It is very hard to tell to a program that `Naruto` and `Boruto` are in the same universe, but they are 2 different stories and therefore 2 different canonicals even tho `Boruto` is marked as the `sequel` of Naruto Shippuden :(

### User Contribution Alpha V1

The manual generation of universes and canonicals brings us to the last but most important achievement of this development iteration:
**Detabesu is no more a read-only** system, but it allows external and manual addition of information to the dataset.

Until now, in fact, all the data Detabesu was serving were the result of a very long, very complex, and totally automated pipeline. We instructed the process about how to parse, organize and merge the data, and the pipeline was doing everything by its own. No human interaction was need and ADMITTED.

With universes and canonicals, we’ve placed the first foundation stone for the user contribution. 
Right now user contribution is limited to 2 single entities, it is not user friendly and requires a good degree of the system. But still, we are able to add and edit information while preserving the automatic pipeline (internally called Wormhole because of the magic of eating raw unstructured data at one extremity and producing Animeshon’s base knowledge at the other end), making the dream of a Community-driven Encyclopedia/Ecosystem more real.



### Next Steps

The development of Animeshon’s ecosystem will continue in different directions.

We want to prioritize the release of a prototype of the **Media Platform** where creators, translators, and consumers will find a green ground to build the first circular economy of the Japanese Multimedia Industry.

Login, Signup and user management have maximum priority and as soon as an Alpha version is ready we want to test it against the Encyclopedia building a simple Contribution manager and a Tracking system integrated into Detabesu and the Encyclopedia .

Most of the components needed from the Media Platform are mandatory and required for the encyclopedia as well, therefore while Detabesu and Encyclopedia’s development will be put on hold for a short period of time, both to wait for Dgraph’s updates and to gather feedback about the Beta v21.02.0 release, their development will not stop completely.

We have also big plans for Ashen, which should be revamped, transferred to a new, more scalable technology, made more usable for developers, and integrated in the same datagraph of Detabesu. We are also looking forward to the potential of a possible combination of Detabesu, [Ashen](https://source.animeshon.com/), and the [Danbooru2020](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2020) trained image indexer AI which might be explored as soon as the manpower will increase.

Regarding Detabesu, once the Media Platform is Alpha-ready, we plan to allocate efforts to redesign the schema to better represent the industry (in particular Doujinshi and Media categorization) and to provide an easier-to-query structure getting rid of useless interfaces, migrating to unions, and explicitly exposing the type of the resource to let the user filter by type at query time.

***Animeshon is growing little step by little step, not all our products are full functionals and not all our service meet the standard of the industry, but you know; Rome was not built in one night.***

Ja ne～
