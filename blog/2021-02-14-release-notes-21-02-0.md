    * index -> identifier
    * ....
    * Check your application and sync the queries.
* Renamed GraphQL fields from singular to plurals: 
    * content -> contents
    * appearance -> appearances 
    * ...
* Check your application and sync the queries.
* Changed rate limits on query* and aggregate* fields to 20 every second
* Schema stitching between Elasticsearch search engine and Detabesu
* Redesign of the CrossReferences:
    * Every external resource might lead to more than one Crossreference node
    * Crossreference nodes might be flag as partial if the external resource doesn’t match perfectly with Animeshon’s resource
    * Every external resource might be linked to more than one Animeshon’s resource
    * Every external resource leads to at most one non-partial CrossReference node
* Greatly improvement of Data-Linking
    * The data in Detabesu and in the Encyclopedia are more interconnected
* Introduction of Universe, Canonical (Series) and Visual Novel Release page
* Introduction of Universe and Canonical (Series) data-structure in Detabesu
* Changed the main source of truth of the Doujinshis from Doujinshi.org to Mangaupdates.com
    * The amount of Doujinshi available in Detabesu is considerably lower, but the quality of the information is higher
* Fix of data interface implementation during the Wormhole migration
    * Using the getMetadata, queryContent, …, query is now possible to retrieve all objects implementing that particular interface making the data easier to retrieve in one shot and without custom logic
* Fix of some couple of hundreds of circular Crossreference which were leading to multiple Anime to have the exact same data.
* Fix of some thousand wrongly parsed contents in the Wormhole pipeline which leads to broken data and type mismatch between Manga and Light Novels
* Minor fixes in the Encyclopedia
