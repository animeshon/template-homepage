  Release Notes
---

* Added GraphQL documentation directly in the schema (available at play.animeshon.com or through compatible GraphQL clients)
* Renamed GraphQL fields for consistency (e.g. "index" -> "identifier"), check your application for breaking changes
* Renamed GraphQL fields from the singular form to plural form (e.g. "appearance" -> "appearances"), check your application for breaking changes 
* Changed rate limits on query* and aggregate* operations to 20 every second
* Schema stitching between Elasticsearch search engine and Detabesu
* Vast improvement of search engine reults
* Redesign of the cross-references:
    * Every external resource might lead to more than one cross-reference node
    * Cross-reference nodes might be flagged as partial if the external resource only matches partially with Animeshon metadata
    * Every external resource might be linked to more than one Animeshon resource
    * Every external resource leads to at most one non-partial cross-reference node
* Vast improvement of Data-Linking
    * The data available in Detabesu is now more interconnected (more cross-references, especially between different media)
* Introduction of Universe, Canonical (Series) and Visual Novel Release page
* Introduction of Universe and Canonical (Series) data-structures in Detabesu
* Changed the main source of truth of the Doujinshis from Doujinshi.org to MangaUpdates.com
    * The amount of Doujinshi available in Detabesu is considerably lower, but the quality of the information is higher and more consistent
* Fix of data interface implementation during the Wormhole migration
    * Using the getMetadata, queryContent, …, queries, it is now possible to retrieve all objects implementing that particular interface making the data easier to retrieve in a single query and without custom logic
* Fix of a few hundreds of circular cross-references which were leading to multiple Anime to have the exact same data
* Fix of a few thousand wrongly parsed contents in the Wormhole pipeline which led to broken data and type mismatch between Manga and Light Novels
* Additional minor fixes and improvements to the Encyclopedia as well as the GraphQL Gateway


### Known Issues

* Some Cross References, in particular in the Doujinshi domain, might be not correct due to the tollerance of the mathing algorithm
