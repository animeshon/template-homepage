# Introduction

Last month we had the pleasure to take part in the first meeting organized by the [Japanese Visual Media Graph](https://jvmg.iuk.hdm-stuttgart.de/) project (Hochschule der Medien - Stuttgart Media University) regarding Information Commons for Manga, Anime and Video Games.

Animeshon together with members of the [Japanese Media Arts Database](https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/about?lang=en) project (Ritsumeikan University Center for Game Studies in Kyoto) and the team of JVMG discussed problems faced during the consolidation of Japanese Multimedia Content. Each party analyzed and presented issues faced in their own domain and solutions are currently being discussed to find common efficient strategies.  

The meeting also opened up opportunities for future collaborations with the aspiration to eventually merge part of the technologies so far developed by each institution and align ontologies (i.e. metadata definitions) among the different projects.
